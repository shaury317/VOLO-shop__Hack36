<p>A marketing strategy creates a clear guide of solutions for your target market.A marketing strategy is a well-thought-out guide for creating solutions for your target market. It allows you to consider how to meet the needs of your ideal customer and strategically fulfill those needs in a cost-effective manner. A marketing strategy has an effect on the profitability of your business, which in turn allows you to measure your value by the customerâ€™s response.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Describe the purpose for creating a marketing plan. Your purpose clearly outlines your motivation and goals. Not having a purpose diminishes the outcome of your marketing plan, because it will lack clarity. Clarity gives you structure and something to build on. Clearly spell out your motivation for creating a marketing strategy.</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>Detail the benefits and value you will offer your customer. Features do not motivate customers to purchase your services or products; they purchase because they have a need or a desire that drives their decision-making. If your benefits clearly solve or meet their need or desire, then you gain a new customer. Therefore, clearly detail the benefits they will receive from purchasing your product or service. Product and services should be created as a solution.</p>

<h3>Target</h3>
<p>Express who your product or services are created for. Clearly define who your target market is by detailing demographic characteristics within our society; such as elementary teachers, tall women, and cellphone owners, for example. Research the problems associated with that group of people and where to find them. Knowing how to reach them gives you the information you need to appropriately market to them.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>Based on your research, you need to decide what is the best way to connect and engage with your target market, including what form of marketing materials or procedures would be effective to showcase your product or services. For example, blog posts, social media, trade shows, direct marketing or email marketing, may work well if your target market is young and into technology.</p>

<h3>Niche</h3>
<p>Your niche is your unique position in the marketplace and how you differ from your competitors. Your competitors could sell the same product or services, but you could deliver them to your customer differently. For example, you both may sell planners, but you could focus on promoting your product to teens if your competitor promotes to moms. You need to serve a unique group in a new way that is appropriate to them.</p>

<h3>Identity</h3>
<p>Consider your ideal customer. How would you characterize your business to appeal to him? What would your colors and logos look like? What would your tagline be? How would you tailor your mission and vision? What would be your primary source of communication and promotion? Answering these questions helps you form your identity.</p>

<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>Create a budget that positions you to make a profit, and revise it so that your expenses create a return on your investment. Understanding what you have to work with helps you to creatively design your strategy. Prioritize your goals so that you can make a great impression, yet allow your business to scale up with your profits.</p>
